In this screenshot it shows that I successfully downloaded Ubuntu-24.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
From the official ubuntu website. The ubuntu I downloaded file size is 3.5GB. 
What I learned:
I learned to identify the correct version of ISO for my setup and the important of downloading and using the official sources to avoid any malware or disruption.

In this screenshot it shows that I use Ubuntu Terminal to install VirtualBox Guest Additions by typing this command in “sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-utils”. This allows me to resize my screen and clipboard sharing between host and guest OS. This help improve the Ubuntu environment usability and more importantly allowing me to copy commands from labs and google.

In this screenshot it shows that Oracle VirtualBox Manager interface. It shows that the Ubuntu is running and shows the configuration details I did on my Ubuntu. I named my VM “Ubuntu” for simplicity and avoid confusion later on, the key setting I configure during installation is changing the Base memory to 4096 MB of RAM doubling the minimum recommended in the lab, 2 CPU cores and 10 GB virtual hard disk. I also set the network adapter to NAT mode, NAT allows me to isolate the VM from my local network while still having access to internet.

This screenshot shows my github repository creation page where I set up new repository named Bridging Reflective Journal. I set the visibility public. This repository will shows what I learned and labs I done during the lesson.
